            <h4><u>Types of Dustbins for Hospital Waste Management</u></h3>
    
                <p><b id="one">1. Yellow Bin:</b> This bin is designated for infectious waste such as used syringes, bandages, contaminated PPE, and pathological waste (tissues and organs). For example, a blood-soaked bandage or a used surgical glove would go into the yellow bin. These items require incineration or autoclaving to prevent infection risks.
                <br><br><b id="two">2. Red Bin:</b> The red bin collects non-infectious hazardous plastic waste, including discarded IV sets, urine bags, and syringes without needles. For instance, an empty IV fluid bag or a used but needle-free syringe would be placed in the red bin. This waste needs disinfection and proper disposal or recycling.
                <br><br><b id="three">3. Blue/White Bin:</b> For non-contaminated recyclable glass waste, such as glass bottles, ampoules, and vials, the blue/white bin is used. An example would be a clean, empty vial of saline solution. This facilitates recycling efforts and ensures that glass waste is handled appropriately.
                <br><br><b id="four">4. Black Bin:</b> The black bin is for general non-hazardous waste, including paper, packaging materials, and food waste. For example, a food wrapper or a used paper towel would go into the black bin. This type of waste can be disposed of with regular municipal waste.
                <br><br><b id="five">5. Green Bin:</b> Organc biodegradable waste, such as food scraps and plant material, goes into the green bin. For instance, leftover food from a hospital cafeteria or plant trimmings from a hospital garden would be disposed of in the green bin. This waste is suitable for composting, promoting environmental sustainability.
                <br><br><b id="six">6. White (Translucent) Puncture-proof Container:</b> This container is used for sharps waste, including needles, scalpels, and broken glass. For example, a used needle or a broken glass ampoule would be placed in the white puncture-proof container. It ensures the safe disposal of sharp objects via incineration or autoclaving to prevent injury and contamination.</p>

            <h4><u>Segregation Procedures</u></h4>
            <p><b>1.Point of Generation:</b> Waste should be segregated at the point where it is generated to avoid cross-contamination. This means placing waste directly into the appropriate color-coded bins immediately after it is produced. For example, used syringes and blood-soaked bandages should be placed into the yellow bin for infectious waste right at the patient's bedside or in the treatment room. This immediate segregation ensures that waste is handled correctly from the outset.
                <br><br><b>2.Proper Labeling:</b> All bins must be clearly labeled with the appropriate waste category and color code to ensure correct usage. Labels should include examples of acceptable waste types to guide staff in making the right choices. For instance, a yellow bin might have a label indicating it is for items like used gloves and contaminated dressings. Clear labeling helps avoid confusion and promotes adherence to segregation protocols.
                <br><br><b>3.Training and Compliance:</b> Regular training sessions are essential to educate healthcare workers on waste segregation protocols and the importance of compliance. These sessions should cover the correct use of color-coded bins, the types of waste that belong in each bin, and the reasons behind these practices. Emphasizing the health and safety benefits of proper waste segregation can motivate staff to follow the guidelines diligently.
                <br><br><b>4.Safe Handling:</b> When dealing with all types of waste, safe handling practices, including the use of protective equipment, must be followed. Healthcare workers should be trained to handle infectious and hazardous waste with extra caution to prevent contamination and injury. For instance, when disposing of sharps, using puncture-proof containers helps protect against needle-stick injuries.
                <br><br><b>5.Transportation:</b> Segregated waste should be transported in color-coded liners or bags to designated disposal areas to maintain segregation and prevent spills. Waste must be securely contained during transport to avoid exposure. For example, infectious waste in yellow liners should be moved to incineration points without being mixed with other types of waste.</p>
